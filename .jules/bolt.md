## 2024-05-23 - Sleep for Safety Anti-Pattern
**Learning:** Found a hardcoded `await page.wait_for_timeout(6000)` in PDF generation to "wait for diagrams". This imposes a 6s penalty on EVERY conversion, even those without diagrams.
**Action:** Always prefer `wait_for_selector` or `wait_for_function` over `sleep`. If sleep is "necessary", condition it on the presence of the element being waited for.

## 2026-02-19 - Regex Compilation in Hot Path
**Learning:** `sanitize_mermaid_code` recompiled regex patterns and redefined helper functions on every invocation. This was inefficient for documents with many mermaid blocks.
**Action:** Moved regex patterns and helper functions to module level constants. Benchmarked ~14.6% improvement.
## 2026-03-03 - Prevent Expensive Browser Launch on Missing Content
**Learning:** Instantiating a headless browser (Playwright) takes significant time and resources. Generating PNGs for files without Mermaid diagrams was spending ~4.5s just to launch the browser, load the page, and realize there was no diagram to capture. Since the `generate_png_core` function is explicitly designed to only capture mermaid diagrams (it calls `element.screenshot()` on `.mermaid` only), launching the browser for files without them is a waste.
**Action:** Always perform a cheap static check (e.g., regex search for the target content) before initiating expensive external processes. Offload file I/O and regex to a thread pool to avoid blocking the async event loop. Early returns for non-applicable states improve throughput massively.

## 2026-03-05 - Concurrent Gallery Mode Race Condition
**Learning:** Running headless browser pages concurrently using `asyncio.gather` requires that shared temporary files (like `.tmp.html`) are uniquely named (e.g., via `uuid`). Otherwise, tasks overwrite each other's HTML files, leading to incorrect screenshots or silent failures.
**Action:** When parallelizing browser tasks, ensure all intermediate file I/O uses unique, non-overlapping paths.

## 2026-03-11 - Fast-path text processing
**Learning:** Found an `O(n)` array manipulation that splits text line-by-line in `generate_docx_core` simply to search for alert elements (`> [!NOTE]`). By implementing an early check with `"[!" in md_text` and a `re.MULTILINE` search, we bypass this expensive block entirely for files without alerts.
**Action:** When parsing specific syntax over large text files, always apply a fast, whole-string existence check before performing line-by-line iterations and array allocations.
