## 2024-05-23 - Sleep for Safety Anti-Pattern
**Learning:** Found a hardcoded `await page.wait_for_timeout(6000)` in PDF generation to "wait for diagrams". This imposes a 6s penalty on EVERY conversion, even those without diagrams.
**Action:** Always prefer `wait_for_selector` or `wait_for_function` over `sleep`. If sleep is "necessary", condition it on the presence of the element being waited for.

## 2026-02-19 - Regex Compilation in Hot Path
**Learning:** `sanitize_mermaid_code` recompiled regex patterns and redefined helper functions on every invocation. This was inefficient for documents with many mermaid blocks.
**Action:** Moved regex patterns and helper functions to module level constants. Benchmarked ~14.6% improvement.

## 2026-03-05 - Concurrent Gallery Mode Race Condition
**Learning:** Running headless browser pages concurrently using `asyncio.gather` requires that shared temporary files (like `.tmp.html`) are uniquely named (e.g., via `uuid`). Otherwise, tasks overwrite each other's HTML files, leading to incorrect screenshots or silent failures.
**Action:** When parallelizing browser tasks, ensure all intermediate file I/O uses unique, non-overlapping paths.
